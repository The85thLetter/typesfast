As if a wolf, quietly waiting for his prey to pass, but also like a deer anticipating danger. He is sitting at his desk, staring and motionless. It was not that he was thinking, but almost like he was not alive. N gives off the impression that he was not a person, but an object. He gives the impression of somebody frozen in euphoria and burning in melancholy.\n\tA teacher gifted noise to the void, “The four quarters are tied by the leaders in Hope. Hope’s district is what governs the world.” Every student shifts to writing down notes, except N, whose thin, cheap paper was only there to abide by the laws. It was a lecture on the world’s composition, about how people of the world are organized by behavior. “Harmony consists of people who are neutral, people who do not want to experience anymore stimulus and are content with their life. Many of these people are the elderly, but there are also people there that are adults who gave up in life.”\n\tN is currently in Hope, but he is not learning anything. A noun only describes what is, not what is to become. Where would a philosopher such as him belong in a moving world?\n\t“Edward,” the teacher shoots gazes in the direction of N. The students turn to see him. “Do you want to be sent to Harmony?” Without replying, N lifts his pen with the grace of a machine and begins to write notes of what the teacher mentioned in the past hour. The instructor resumes the lesson.\n\tN is uninterested in being a student. He believes that this world is boring and uneventful but he continues to write until class is over.\n\tWhen an alarm rings, the teacher finishes their words and dismisses the class. All except N rises and bows, then leaves the classroom in an orderly line. The instructor approaches N and begins to speak.\n\t“What is wrong?” they ask.\n\t“I don’t know,” N replies.\n\t“Would you actually like it if I make a request to send you to Harmony?”\n\t“I don’t know.”\n\t“Well, it wasn’t your choice anyways. Quarter-transferring is decided by the governors here.”\n\t“Chaos.”\n\t“What?”\n\t“I want to be sent to Chaos.”\n\t“I will consider it.”\n\n\tAfter class are services. People are required to benefit the community in some way during the next few hours. N settles on a white bench and stays. In this time, he silently counts in binary. Seconds pass as he stays unproductive. Only after half an hour is the figure startled by noise.\n\t“Hey!” shouts a person with dirty gloves. When the gloves fall into N’s vision, a crisp image of a land mass is conjured in his mind. The setting of this vision is not underground, but in a strange place without walls or ceilings. That is the very point where N wonders what will be in a world without familiarities. He makes a mental note to review this concept later.\n\tN looks up at the person with dirty gloves, not speaking.\n\t“What are you doing?”\n\t“I don’t know,” N claims.\n\t“Well, come help me garden,”, the person walks to a patch of grass, encrusted with dirt. To N, only sad flowers struggle to stand in the canvas of grassy blades. It reminded N of the boring world. “You want to be as helpful as you can to society before you can relax in Harmony. Those people in Chaos and Pain have no idea what they are doing. It is up for us to care for them, right?” the gardener looks back at N. N reluctantly uses energy to lift his body from the bench and heads towards the gardener. The sweet stench of pollen and cut grass saturate the air.\n\t“Such a boring smell,” N whispers.\n\t“Sorry, could you repeat that?”\n\t“Nothing.”\n\tLike a machine, N aids the person with the task of caring for life.\n\n\tThe night bell rings, the reverberation of it lingers around the Quarter. People from all over Hope walk to the cells. They arrange themselves in long lines, which are processed quickly. Of all of them, N is the last. While waiting to enter his designated cell, he stares in the ground. The image of dirt is cast on his mind. He brainstorms.\n\n\tThe universe has a preset, dirt. This preset fills every unit of space, so people have to build rooms. The most largest rooms are known as the Quarters; the Quarters are Harmony, Hope, Pain, and Chaos. Whenever a wall breaks, a large amount of dirt is released. What if this preset was something else? Would it be like an infinitely large room? What would the horizon look like? Would it be the color of the walls or the color of nothing? And in that case, what is the color of nothing? How will the room be lit, with ceiling or floor lights? Will the lights even light up the entire room? Such a concept can only exist in Chaos.\n\tQuestions like these baffled N. For the first time in a while, N feels enlightened. There is a reason for N to live. N feels alive.\n\n\tDuring all the moments that he spends thinking, the line diminishes like the knowledge of the universe. When N looks up, he is the only person left waiting. Soon, it is his turn to enter his cell. The tight room is a shining white, which is meant to be kept dark. There is only enough space for one person, and this space is a controlled area where a person’s needs is satisfied overnight. This is where N is supposed to get both energy and rest.\nAfter he walks inside, the gap to the outside wanes until it is touching. N sees this process and saves it into his subconscious. He closes his eyes, liquid rises from his feet. Eventually, it covers his entire body, even his head. With that, he goes into hibernation.\n\nIt feels as if no time has passed when the warm fluid drains from the cell. N opens his eyes, feeling refreshed. The door to his room slowly opens again, revealing light and Hope. Once again, he focuses on this movement. The memory is fuel for curiosity.\nWhen he exits the cell, N joins the people outside waiting in a line. All of them move forward to various buildings. The people are orderly distributed between classes at a school. While this process in ongoing, N whispers to himself.\n“Un-du-quin-quin, un-du-se-nought, un-du-se-quin, un-du-sept-nought, un-du-sept-tre. That’s five less than yesterday.”\nN notices that the amount of people in Hope decreases by little everyday. A detail so miniscule would never be observed by a regular person, but N has seen it. \nHe starts to think of reasons behind such a phenomenon. Could they be transferring between Quarters? Nobody that has disappeared has ever returned. In that case, the people managing Quarters should be bringing more young people into Hope to match the amount that leaves. If this event continues, the entire world will run out of workers and society will fall. Could a mistake or dilema have been the cause? One like the idea of an infinite room or the color of nothing?\nAsking himself these questions, an epiphany hits N. He very quietly speaks to himself, “What if people are expendable? Like pencils or gloves?” The idea sounds so alien to him that he wants to deny it. Such a thing only exists in Chaos. To him, Chaos sounds like a horrid gift. Like the concept of a truth, but not. He cannot find the words to describe it. N, dissatisfied, falls back to calling the concept “labelling a flower as grass.”\nN enters the last classroom with the remaining people in line. He stands by the chair of the furthest back seat. At once, every student bows then sits down. In the first minute, everybody brings out the materials needed for class. N is able to prepare in the span of two seconds. In the rest of that time, he chooses simplistic actions. Today, he will keep his pose perfectly symmetrical, even mirroring movements such as with the fingers and mouth. The only thing he will not replicate is his writing. His goal is to achieve as little attention as possible. A clear mirror, that anyone can predict but still see the standard in.\nAfter that, everybody turns to the teacher. The six-hour session begins. The teacher starts by relating to yesterday’s topic, then transitioning into a new one: “While the leaders of Hope are an influence on our lives, there is an internal factor as well. This concept is called age, in which there are three phases of...”\nN recalls hearing this exact lesson before, from a different teacher a long time ago. This is not a surprise to him, as he already has attention to each pattern of this society. Bored, he recites to himself quietly, “Young, adult, and elderly. These three stages are identified age by a person’s productivity level. A young person is very motivated to do services, an adult is less motivated to work and has more drive to learn, and elderly work and learn at a moderate pace. It is common for older people to go to Harmony…”\nEventually, N feels a bump in the smooth landscape. A realization. N tries to think of a description. Two things that don’t fit together so much that it creates a problem. For now, he decides to call it an “En”. The sound of such a term starts with a vowel and ends with a consonant. Similarly, an En starts gracefully but ends abruptly. If truth was yes, then En would be no.\nThe idea he stumbled upon was with the ages. It is obvious that a person becomes more elderly as time goes on, but what about the young? If elderly typically go to Harmony, where do the young come from? Certainly not from Hope. Is it Pain, Chaos, or maybe somewhere else? It is also possible that the young come from Harmony, as unmotivated people who gain a drive. N concludes that the entire thing is a cycle, that the young becomes adults, who become elderly, who once again transform in the young. With this revelation, he dismisses the idea that humans were expendable. He silently relaxes in response.\n“Edward,” the teacher calls while everybody turns, “You should be writing. And why do you look so relieved?”\nBoring. N had forgotten how boring everybody else was. While N was making discoveries in his head, everybody else was writing down repeated information. He has a choice. N could ask the teacher to check his theory, learning something new while inspiring others, or he could keep the idea for himself and not risk chaos. Chaos may not be so bad.\n“Excuse me, teacher,” N raises his hand.\n“Yes?” \n“Where do the young come from?” He anticipates the exact answer he had devised in his head. If so, the boring world N lived in may not be boring at all.\n\nN’s face is uniform. The wrists of his two arms meet together under his chin, with his cheeks resting on his curled fingers. As if a wolf, quietly waiting for his prey to pass, but also like a deer anticipating danger. He is sitting at his desk, staring and motionless. It was that he was thinking, and almost like he was alive. N gives off the impression that he was a person, but not an object. And yet, he still gives the impression of somebody frozen in euphoria and burning in melancholy.\n\nDu\n\n\tThe teacher silently vocalizes their answer. N intensely observes the movement of the lips and tongue. Nobody else hears the silent voice except N. I cannot answer that. It says. That response is enough to take the attention of N. He reminds himself to review this later. Knowing this, he predicts the teacher’s actions of the following seconds.\n\tThe instructor must answer with a neutral response to avoid an outrage with students. In the situation beneath where the teacher actually does not know the real answer, the teacher will say just that. It is also possible for the instructor to say that exact thing to hide the truth. If that happens, it is certain that N will be sent to transfer districts.\n\t“Hide the truth?” N questions, “That is just like the infinite room; it is an En.”\n\tN watches reality play. The teacher pauses before speaking.\n\t“I do not know the answer to that question.”\n\tWhen N looks around at the other students, he can tell that their expressions have shifted. They seem nervously calm.\n",
//  "Sky Marks \n Chapter 1\n\n\t“Are you awake?” I hear a voice say in the darkness. “Hello?” It sounds soothing. “What is your name?”\n\t“I do not know,” I think to say.\n\t“She looks like she is about to awake,” I hear a different voice say.\n\t“What is your name?”\n\t“Dagel. My name is Dagel.” Silence.\n\t“It looks like she is trying to speak,” the first voice says.\n\t“Dagel,” I hear it aloud. “Dagel,” is that my name?\n\tI open my eyes and see a blue sky. I realized I am lying on a soft patch of dirt. Two people are staring at me, they must be the ones who have been speaking.\n\tOne of them extends their arm. I grab it and she pulls me up. I can tell by her expression. She is the first voice. Her hair is dyed bright orange and she seems to have happy, bright eyes. She is wearing a belt that holds a small dagger. The other one has dark, long hair with a serious face. She is wearing a black cape marked with blue around the edges.\n\t“Dagel, do you remember anything about how you got here?” asks the serious one.\n\tIt then strikes me that I cannot recall any memories.\n\t“My name is Dagel,” I announce.\n\t“Useless,” I feel her stare deep into my soul.\n\t“She isn’t useless!” argues the happy one. “Hello, my name is Summer, this is my partner, Night.”\n\tNight sighs, “Hello and welcome to your one-way ride to death. This world is called the Plane as in the flattest surface you will spend the rest of your life on,” she stated emotionlessly.\n\t“Wait, where are we?” I question.\n\t“We are on the Plane,” answers Summer, “It is a flat world accompanied by four meteorologic bodies we call Sky Marks.”\n\tI look up at the sky. I see what she means, what appears to be a blue sphere is in the sky. The sphere seems to be faded, as if it were incredibly far away, but it seems to take up a third of the sky’s view. Behind me, I see a golden band that surrounds floating mass, sky islands. It seems impossible as the islands defy gravity, and the yellow band visibly rotates around them. A third figure, is a huge white arc that goes from one side of the horizon to the other. These must be the Sky Marks, but a Sky Mark that touches the ground seems out of place, even in this strange world. I look around for the fourth Sky Mark, assuming it is the sun, but I cannot locate it, even though daylight is everywhere.\nA fantasy world? I believe that floating islands, a large blue planet, and an arc cannot exist over a flat world along with the absence of the sun.\n“I think she noticed the Sky Marks,” I hear Summer say, but I ignore it. I am awestruck with this world.\n“It is funny how she did not notice the environment she is in,” says Night.\n“Give her some time to process information.”\nJust then, I stop looking at the sky. I notice a huge tree far in the distance, a huge tree. The tree appears to be unrealistically large, miles in height. There, I realize we are in a forest. A forest tinted blue. Blue leaves, blue trees, blue grass. Everything seems to have an enchanted aura.\n\tI remember something, where I have come from. I say to the two people in front of me.\n\t“This is not Earth.”\n\n\tAfter I had gotten over the fact I was in this world, Summer and Night began to explain things more carefully.\n\t“So there are four Sky Marks,” explained Summer, “The most obvious one is the Exo-Plane.”\n\t“That is the blue planet,” Night says with a colorless voice.\n\t“I’m sure you have noticed it, we call it the Exo-Plane because it is a separate place from the Plane. It might look scary, but it isn’t actually that large.”\n\t“Why does it look so far away?” I ask.\n\t“The Exo-Plane has a blue, misty atmosphere, that’s why it might seem blurry,” said Night with the least enthusiasm.\n\tI look back up to the blue planet, this time, it is very clear that it has a hazy fog.\n\t“Why doesn’t it fall?” I start a string of questions, “How close is it? Can you get up there? Has anyone ever done it?”\n\t“We don’t really know why the Sky Marks stay up there,” answers Summer, “One day, we woke up in this world. We tried to find a way back to where we came from, but eventually adjusted. We live here and got used to the strange properties of this world.”\n\t“It is possible to get onto the Exo-Plane, but it is only possible to do once a year.” I stare at Night. She waits. “Oh, you do not know about the sun. I think I can explain the way the Ring works.” Sigh. “The Ring, is the third largest Sky Mark in this world.” Summer points at the silver arc. “We call it the Ring because it goes around the entire sky.”\n\t“Why is it considered a Sky Mark if it touches the ground?”\n\t“It does not,” Night looks disappointed, “The Ring goes around the edge of the Plane. It acts as our sun, if you did not know, the Plane is circular. The Ring slowly rotates around the entire Plane, one full rotation is 365 days, a year. The Ring also emits light and heat, the amount of light varies. Every 24 hours, a night begins, when the Ring stops shining light. The night eventually becomes day, when it starts to gradually shine light again.”\n\tSummer speaks again. “You probably understand the concept of day and night, but the Ring also adjusts to seasons.”\n\t“Does the Ring ever line up with the horizon?” I ask.\n\t“No.” Night.\n\t“I only see three Sky Marks, where is the fourth?”\n\t“I assume you mean the Exo-Plane, the Ring, and the Crescent,” Summer starts to explain, “The Fourth is not visible right now, I have to explain the Crescent before I tell you about the Other Side.”\n\t“The Other Side?”\n\t“Each Sky Mark has its own movement path.” Night. “The Exo-Plane is stationary, so we use it as a control for navigating the other Sky Marks. The Ring does a full rotation every 365 days. The Crescent appears to move randomly, but lines up with the Exo-Plane every 30 days. And the Other Side only appears when all the Sky Marks line up. It looks like another Plane flipped upside-down above us.”\n\t“About the Crescent,” Summer speaks again, “It is a smaller band, like the Plane’s Ring, that surrounds a network of floating islands. It isn’t actually a crescent, we call it that because it looked that way when we first appeared here.”\n\t“Exo-Plane, Ring, Crescent, and the Other Side.” I repeat the names of the Sky Marks, “It sounds fun.”\n\n\tAfter teaching me about the Sky Marks, they start guiding me out of the blue forest towards the giant tree. I still do not understand what allows a tree to be this large, but I should not care as everything in this world doesn’t make any sense.\n\t“It this tree real?” I ask.\n\t“This is the Colossus Tree, it was the first thing we noticed when we appeared in this world,” Night says with the flavor of water. “We do not know why it is so large, but it seems to be the center of this world.”\n\t“Night and I are not the only ones who live in this world.” Spring disappears and Summer speaks. “Though we seem like we have power in this world, we do not know much of it. We were the first to appear, on the first day, we saw three aligned objects in the sky and a world above us. On the first day, all the Sky Marks were aligned and the Other Side was visible, so we thought those were the fixed positions of them. On the next day, we noticed the Crescent had moved and that the Other Side was gone. Night decided to head for the Colossus Tree, we built shelter and lived for a month on the Plane. We created names for the objects in the sky and features of this world. After a month or so, we found people sleeping in the forest you were in. We taught them what we knew, and it eventually became a village. Every year since then, more and more people were found.”\n\t“Eventually, no more people came. Summer was surprised when we found you,” Night. “We use the Colossus sort of like a beacon. In case we ever get lost, we can always find our way back to the village.”\n\tI see ahead of us, the forest starts to clear. The blue tint starts to fade away and we seem to enter a shadow. I look up and see the giant tree above us. I slowly start to see the village appear ahead of us. When we finally exit the forest, Summer runs in front of me, gesturing her arms towards the opening.\n\t“Welcome to Rootbased Village!” Summer seems very enthusiastic. Night sighs, she shows no enthusiasm. Many people turn around towards my direction with a surprised face. They must have not seen a new person in a while.\n\tWhat I see next amazes me. There seems to be multiple floors of Rootbased Village. The first floor is built on the ground of dirt and green grass. The floors above it are supported by wooden beams and platforms made of wooden planks. Though the canopy of the Colossus is blocking the sunlight from the Ring, there are many candles hanging from wooden beams or placed upon wooden pikes to keep the village illuminated. Each floor is filled with people, everyone seems to be in a cheerful mood.\n\tA small girl half my size runs up to us, “Hey Summer, who is that?”\n\t“This is Dagel,” Summer speaks in a kind voice.\n\t“Where did Dabbel come from?”\n\t“We found her in the Enchanted earlier, she is new here.” The child looks at me and smiles, then I notice that the child is holding a stick.\n\t“Hey Trustina, can you please bring Dagel to the Observatory?”\n\t“Sure!” The child grabbed my hand and started running into the village. I look around as we travel through the village, the path we are on is made of stones. The first floor has many gardens and small houses, each one is made of thatch and logs. There are no doors, and the windows are just holes in the walls. Many people seem to carry weapons like spears, swords, bows, and daggers.\n\tTrustina eventually leads me to a staircase, she drags me up three floors. The fourth floor is exposed to the sky, or at least the canopy of the Colossus. The paths on the higher floors seem to be made of a polished stone. I am guided through a network of houses, until we reach an opening. There, a bridge connects Rootbased Village to a small hill that isn’t covered by the Colossus. On the hill, a small tower seems to be built, isolated from other buildings.\n\t“This is the Observatory,” the child says with a smile, “Follow me.”\n\tThis structure, unlike the houses, has a wooden door. The tower is built from bricks of stone, with glass windows. Trustina opens the door, to my surprise, the room is filled with nothing except a round table with a blue orb and a ladder to the next floor. The ball has a strange purple aura and is transparent.\n\t“What is that?” I ask, pointing at the orb.\n\t“That is the magic ball,” Trustina pulls out the stick from earlier, “Watch this.”\n\tShe holds the stick in one of her hands, it takes me a while to understand what she is doing. She closes her eyes and starts to chant.\n\t“Gly Sen Laten Murat”\n\tMagic. Particles start to materialize around the orb and get absorbed by her wand. The stick starts to illuminate blue and raindrops start to rise from the ground and levitate in the air.\n\t“Chlron An”\n\tI feel the world around slow down. The droplets of water stop rising and start to slowly drift down. I look at Trustina and see that she is concentrating. This scene seems unrealistic, yet it is happening right in front of me.\n\t“Gly May”\n\tSuddenly, the world returns to its normal speed. The water droplets stop moving, then combust, spraying water everywhere. Trustina opens her eyes and smiles at me.\n\t“Are you are sorcerer?” I question the child.\n\t“They call me a mage. All the adults say I am very good at magic,” smile.\nShe puts her wand away and skips towards the ladder. “Come on, follow me!”\n\n\tWe climb up nine floors until we reach a level with no ceiling. On this floor, I have a high view of the world. From the edge of the horizon, I see what appears to be a tall mountain range. This mountain range around the entire horizon. From there, a see a vast desert that paints the feet of the mountains. Before it, leading all the way to the tower are forests, I can see where the Enchanted Forest starts and ends.\n\tAround me are bookshelves and telescopes. In the center of this roof is a table and four chairs around it. I wonder what is the point of this room.\n\t“Aren’t you ever afraid of it raining and ruining this layout?”\n“It never rains here by the Colossus,” I look at the clear, blue sky. There are no clouds in my vision, but the three visible Sky Marks are there. I assume that a magical force prevents any clouds from forming near the tree. “This is the Observatory, we use it to study the Sky Marks. This entire tower was built before I got here, it is used to explore magic.”\n\t“What were those words you said earlier to execute that magic spell?”\n\t“I think I used more than one spell. I think they words I used were special words that we do magic with. I don’t know, go ask Miss Night, she knows stuff about magic.”\n\t“I understand what the telescopes are, but why are there books here?”\n\t“Those books are old, I don’t read them,” smile, “I read the books downstairs, I think these are about the Sky Marks.” I walk around the Observatory, and take a book from the bookshelves. I flip through the pages looking for more information. I understand what Trustina means about “Those books are old,” the books are covered in dust and have wrinkled pages. The binding feels like leather, and the yellow pages feel rough and crispy. I put the book down and look through one of the telescopes. It seems to be made out of an aluminium-like metal. Through it, I see the Exo-Plane. I can’t see much detail because of the hazy blue atmosphere.\n\t“Why did Summer want me to go here?”\n\t“I think she might have wanted you to see magic,” smile, “I want to show you some more!” The child climbs down the ladder and I follow her. We go down two floors, to a room of bookshelves that go to the ceiling. She sits down at a chair by a table and her wand emerges again.\n\t“I thought you didn’t like reading books about the Sky Marks.”\n\t“Silly, the Sky Marks are cool, but these are spell books and grimoires,” she swings her legs, “Do you want to do magic?”\n\t“Sure,” I say with uncertainty and doubt. I do not think a child can teach me magic. “But I do not remember spells and do not have a magic weapon.”\n\t“All the adults say I am very good at magic,” I think they only say that because she is a child, “Hold this.” She jumps out of her seat and gives me the spell book and her wand.\n\t“Why are you giving me your wand?” I look at the book, it is opened to a page with many strange words.\n\t“Do not worry, I have a magic weapon,” she smiles at me again, “Just say the first line.” I feel endangered, but I try it anyways. I read the first line in my head.\n\tDlesh Sen Teal\n\t“What does this mean?” I ask, but she ignores me. She closes her eyes like before and makes an incantation.\n\t“Quil Dy Dy”\n\tThen, a glowing blue book materializes and hovers in front of her. It flips to a random page by itself.\n\t“Saic Pla”\n\tThe world around me disappears and is replaced by a flat, endless, blue land if it were not already flat and endless. She opens her eyes and glances at the book. Smile. She looks at me and says, “Battle me.”\n\n\tShe starts by looking at her hovering book. Her eyes rapidly move back and forth as the pages flip unaided. About a second later, her eyes focus on a single point and the pages stop moving. She looks back at me and starts to glow that familiar blue color once again, this time with her eyes open.\n\t“Byld Na Gly Laten”\n\tA icy sword appears before her, the book closes and vanishes as she grabs the weapon. She charges at me and starts swinging. The frozen weapon makes contact with my left leg first. After touching me, my leg becomes completely numb and useless. I fall to that ground and scramble backwards. She holds the sword with two hands and holds it over her head as if she is about the stab me. I think quickly and remember about the spell she told me.\n\t“Dlesh Sen Teal!” I shout.\n\tShe stops for a while and looks at me surprised, then she smiles. I didn’t understand why it had no effect until I see the wand lying on the ground. I kick it towards my hand with my right leg and hold it firmly. It glows.\n\t“Dlesh Sen Teal”\nThis time, it worked. An armor appears on my body as Trustina swings downward. They sword doesn’t even dent it, and instead shatters into shards of ice. My leg moves again and I stand up.\nSmile. “I am amazed,” the world of the plane appears again and we are in the tower. “Did Miss Night teach you any magic before you got here?” she asks. She grabs the wand back from my hands, the armor I wore disappears. “Normally, people can’t even control magic until they use a stronger tool, but I gave you a boring stick with small magic powers.”\n“What was that? You almost hurt me with that sword!”\n\t“Don’t worry, I am good with magic. All the adults say I am very good with magic.”\n\t“I heard, but what was that flying book thing?”\n\t“The book? I think you mean my magic weapon, Gly Teal, the Relic of the Lakes, the Codex of Water. It came from this world, no one here made it, I found it at the bottom of a lake when I was exploring with Miss Night.”\n\t“Codex of Water? How good are you actually with Magic?”\n\t“I told you already, silly. All the adults say I am very good with magic,” smile. She starts to climb down the ladder.\n\t“How well? Give me a rank for something for example.”\n\t“My name is Trustina, I am the Mage of Gly. I am the fourth best mage on the Plane and I study water magic.”\n\tSmile.\n\n\tAfter introducing me to magic, Trustina brought me to Night and Summer. She walks me down the bridge and back to Rootbased Village. This time, I feel like she is an adult monitoring me, instead of an energetic kid.\n\t“Mage of Gly,” she had said. “What is Gly?” I think to myself. Instead of bringing me back to the forest entrance, she brings me to an entrance to the Colossus on the third level. It is a large arch that opens to the interior of the tree.\n\t“You can go in there?” I ask Trustina.\n\t“Yeah, the Colossus is hollow, but you can’t get all the way to the top from here. Has Miss Night told you about the path to the Crescent yet?”\n\t“Wait, you can actually get to the other Sky Marks?” I remember Night telling me it is possible to get to the Exo-Plane, but I do think she told me how.\n\t“If you climb up the Colossus, there are branches that extends over some of the Crescents positions,” smile. I look up at the few miles high Colossus, I don’t feel comfortable thinking of climbing the trunk. “There is a small village that is at the place where the tree starts branching out. You can climb a staircase from the inside to there, then you have to navigate the branches to get on the Crescent.”\n\t“The Colossus was here when Night and Summer first appeared,” I say completely stunned. “It stands miles high and prevents any rainfall around it.”\n\t“Hurry up, Miss Night and Summer are waiting for us.” We walk into the enormous tree. The natural structure is completely hollow. Everything inside it is illuminated by green, floating torches.\n\t“Magic,” I say to myself. A large, wooden, spiral staircase is centered in the structure, it bridges off into many platforms braced on the side of the tree. From there, small doors lead to the outside of the trunk, to balconies and terraces. The ground is a series of platforms as well, but being held over a floor of roots and fallen leaves. Trustina brings me towards the central stairway and out towards one of the bridges. This bridge is larger than the rest and is suspended by rope. After crossing the bridge and reaching the platform, I realized that there is no exit from here.\n\t“Where do we go?”\n\t“Just watch,” smile. She closes her eyes and her grimoire appears.\n\t“Quil Na Pla”\n\tA blue portal appears on the wooden wood beside us. “Go,” the child says. Smile. We walk through the vibrant door and appear in a different place.\n\tThis place is like a palace, made of a polished, gray stone. The is a large room before us, aside from the empty center is two spiral stairways to a higher balcony. Under it, accessible from our level, are double-doors made of a smooth, silver material.\n\t“Where are we?”\n\t“Miss Night’s place. This is the Gray Home of the Caverns of the Plane,” smile. A small slab of stone drifts down with Night sitting on it, legs crossed.\n\t“Hello,” she stares at me emotionlessly.\n“Hello?” I reply with confusion.\n“I never wanted a living place like this, but the architects insisted to constructing a place for me.” I glanced around again. \n\t“This place is beautiful,” I compliment Night with.\n\t“Unnecessary. Useless, I do not need a fancy area for myself, so I made it public,” she looks at me, “Follow me,” she relaxes and the slab of rock hovers towards the silver door I saw earlier. She raises her arm.\n\t“Dae”\n\tThe doors open, even though she did not have any magic tool by her side.\n\t“Why didn’t she need a magic weapon?” I whisper to Trustina.\n\t“She is an advanced mage, kinda like me using a stick. I can execute spells even though it has low magic power, but Miss Night does not need any aid from any magic sources.” I look at Night, her face always seems to be concentrating, she must be a very high level mage.\n\tWe enter a quiet library lined with marble bookshelves filled with books of all sizes and materials. Candles of a purple flame line the edges of the room and fly around. There are many people here studying the books, but they seem to notice Night as she glides down the aisles with a floating stone. They all seem to be amazed, their faces filled with admiration. Night brings us to an empty space with marble furniture and piles of books.\n“Sit down here,” she gestures towards a couch. Trustina and I take a seat on the cold material. Night jumps off her transport.\n\t“Saic”\n\tThe grey slab disappears.\n\t“Time to lecture,” Night says with a monotone voice.\n\t“Yay!” shouts Trustina with a smile.\n\n\t“So in this world, many things are based off of features from a planet called Earth,” Night educates with a bland voice, “The time intervals of certain things are \nEarth-based, such as the time it takes for the Crescent to align with the Exo-Plane is a month. The time for the emission of light from the Ring to cycle are called days. The time it takes for the Ring to fully rotate is called a year. We have alterations of light every year we consider seasons. Also, life forms like trees and land features like mountains also seem to be Earth-based. My conclusion is that this world is created by a human from Earth.”\n\t“Miss Night,” Trustina raises her hand, “If I was born on the Plane, how do I know what Earth is like?”\n\t“You do not,” Night says directly, “No one here really does, we only have vague memories of Earth, so we conclude that the creator purposely removed our memories, we will refer to this person as simply Creator for this lesson.”\n\t“Why would Creator build a world like this and put people in here?” I question.\n\t“We do not know. We do know that Creator had built a flat world with four meteorological objects. The Creator lined this world with tools, like magic tools and fighting weapons. There, an entire language is inscripted into the mechanics of magic. The Creator went through the difficulties, to program a system of magic for this world. Therefore, we will use this tool Creator gave us to find the meaning for this universe.”\n\t“Can you explain to Dabbel the mechanics of the combat in this world?” asks Trustina.\n\t“There are two forms of Combat on the Plane, we call them Magic and Physical,” Night says lifelessly, “Each of these forms are divided into five sections and subsections. Because I do not know much about physical combat, I will have Summer explain that to you. The five sections of Magic here, we call them Shatters, Lux, Murat, Gly, and Cast.”\n\t“Instead of sections, we call them elements when we are talking about Magic,” Trustina explains.\n\t“On the Plane, there are five experienced mages we call Ranked. These Ranked are specialized in one specific element, and goes hunting for the relics left by Creator.”\nThe words “I am the fourth best mage on the Plane” repeat in my head. “Is Trustina is the Mage of Gly or the Ranked Fourth of the mages on the Plane?” I ask aloud.\n\t“Very smart!” Trustina compliments with a smile, “Miss Night here is our first mage, Ranked First, Mage of Shatters, The Queen of Dark Magic.”\n\t“Unnecessary. Those titles are just names we give to regular people a small amount more proficient than the ones slightly below. It makes us no different, we are just mages who hunt for relics.” Then I remember the relic Trustina used, the Codex of Water. She must have been working hard to find that book. I wonder if Night has a relic of the Plane.\n\t“How many relics are there?” I ask.\n\t“There are four,” smile, “We have relics that represent the Gly, Shatters, Lux, and Murat. We are missing a fifth-” Night cuts her off.\n\t“We are going off the conversation, I was talking about the sub-elements. We cannot ignore Chlron and Na, they are some of the most powerful. When you are traveling through the Plane, keep in mind that not all mages use the five base-elements as their main.”\n\t“Can you please translate what each of the words mean? I don’t understand this magical language.”\n\t“Gly is the element of water, Shatters is the element of darkness. Enough has been taught now, Trustina, please introduce to Dagel to the forms of physical combat in this world.”\n\t“Right!” Trustina grabs my hand and walks me back towards the entrance.\n\n\tTrustina brings me to the arch of the Colossus, where I see the sky and its Sky Marks again. She gives me directions on where to go to find Summer.\n\t“Go to the right,” smile, “There should be wooden stairs down to the surface, then there is a big lake with a dock. Go around the lake and there should be a house that has smoke coming from behind it. Have my wand in case you get into any trouble,” she presses the wand into my hand, “Good luck!”\n\tShe pushes me forward and walks back into the giant tree. I follow her directions atop the wooden floor. I find a vine on the ground and tie it to my waist like a belt. I hide the wand Trustina gave me with it. It appears as she described it, wooden stairs down to the surface, but then I get lost. I cannot find a lake anywhere. I wander off ahead, hoping to find it. I cannot find anything, and get lost into the blue forest. When I have descended deep enough into the forest, I decide to head back out. Being smart, I find an opening to the sky and look for the Colossus.\n\tThere, I see the great tree towering over the world and start to walk back to it. On my way there, I see a little boy about the size of Trustina walking through the woods. He is wearing a green hat with a brown cloak.\n\t“Hey!” I shout, “Do you know where a lake is?” I see him glance over here and then draw a bow.\n\t“Battle me and then I will lead you to this lake,” he challenges.\n\t“I do not have any weapons,” I say, even though I have a wand.\n\t“I will bring you to the lake then find you a weapon. Will you fight me then?” he asks with a pleading voice.\n\t“Sure, what is your name?”\n\t“My name is Loy, are you new to this world?”\n\t“Yes, I’m trying to find my friend. My name is Dagel.”\n\t“Follow me.”\n\tHe guides me out of the forest and to a large lake. The lake seems calm, it sparkles under the light of the Ring. There is a dock perched upon it, a large dock that has many houses upon it.\n\t“This is North Lake Village,” says Loy, “It is a series of houses suspended above water. Where is your friend?”\n\t“There should be a house on the other side of the lake.”\n\t“Let’s go!”\n\tLoy and I walk around the tranquil lake, as it beautifully shimmers under the presence of the Sky Marks. After getting across, I see no smoke in the sky, contrary to what Trustina said.\n\t“There is supposed to be a house here,” I say, “But there seems to be nothing here.”\n\t“Maybe it is deeper into the blue forest,” Loy suggests.\n\tWe venture into the forest, yet I cannot locate Summer’s location. As we are walking down a trail in the blue forest, I hear something to my right. Loy quickly draws a bow, loads it, then fires. A shadow runs behind a nearby tree.\n\t“Watch out!” warns Loy, “It may be a monster.” I expect to hear that from a child his age. This shadowed figure jumps out of the bushes, I see that it is a person. The man wears a red scarf and a leather belt. He is holding a sword in his hand while another lies on his belt.\n\t“You,” he points his sword at me, “You are new here.”\n\t“Careful,” Loy whispers.\n\t“It is said that the final person to arrive on the Plane,” he pauses, “Will complete a game, set up by the Creator.”\n\t“What?” I ask.\n\t“The hero will unscramble the puzzle that we call the Sky Mark. This person will visit the monuments and find the meaning of this world stark. Watch the seasons dance as petals dance down a river. See the evil night and fall and die with a shiver. Go towards the end of your quest to see truth and die forever. But when you come back to save our souls, the Plane exists never.” After reciting the poem, the person runs back into the woods. Loy and I try to forget what happened and head back towards the lake.\n\n\t“What is the name of this friend you are looking for?” Loy asks.\n\t“Her name is Summer, she-” he interrupts.\n\t“Summer?” he sounds surprised, “Like lord Summer? The leader of the lost? Why didn’t you tell me? Everyone knows Summer, she is the one who united everyone on the Plane. She is excellent with physical combat, especially throwing weapons. I understand why you got lost. You must have been talking about the Blacksmith behind the South Lake.”\n\t“There are two lakes?”\n\t“Yes, I thought you would know by now. On the Plane, the terrain on one side is exactly the same as the other. Summer assumes this is because the Creator did not want the path to the Ring to be varied. As you know probably know, it is possible to get to the Ring. If you go far enough, you will reach the edge of the world. From there, you can easily get onto the Ring as it scrapes the edge of the world.”\n\t“How can you stand on the Ring? Wouldn’t you fall down if you walked off the edge?”\n\t“There is gravity on the Plane. The gravity pulls you towards the Colossus, because it is at the center of the Plane. As you get farther from it, the world should feel steeper. By the time you get to the edge, you would be going straight up.”\n\t“I understand it now,” I follow, “So you can get to the Exo-Plane and the Other Side from the Ring.”\n\t“Not exactly, no one has ever gotten to the Other Side, but you can get to the Ring. Anyways, there are two points where the Ring meets the edge, so the Creator decided to make both ways to them equally difficult by mirroring them.”\n\t“So there are two lakes, but one Colossus because it is in the center. How do you differentiate the two?”\n\t“The Exo-Plane guides us, it is stationary. ‘North’ is the direction towards the Exo-Plane.”\n\t“I heard that magic relics are found throughout the terrain, are they affected by the mirror?”\n\t“No, I believe the mirror affects only the terrain and not the objects placed in it.”\n\tWhen we escape the Enchanted Forest, Loy walks me around the Colossus to the South Lake. The structure upon the South Lake are incredibly similar to the North Lake Village. Beyond the shimmering lake, I see smoke rise.\n\tI point to it. “There,” I say.\n\tWhen we get around the lake, I see a small camp. Tents are setup in a large circle around a center. Beyond this main ring, smaller circles of tents exist. In the center of this forest clearing is a building made of bricks, like the Observatory tower. Loy walks me into the Blacksmith. There are weapon racks that hold swords, axes, spears, and other weapons and armor stands that wear sets of metal armor. Centered in the room is an anvil with a hammer on it and a furnace. I see Summer standing by a wall staring at an armor set.\n\t“Hey Summer!” I call out. She turns around and laughs.\n\t“What took you so long?” she looks at Loy, “Why are you here Loy?”\n\t“I brought Dagel here because she got lost by the North Lake.”\n\t“Sounds like something she would do,” she walks to the other side of the room and grabs a throwing knife. She walks to me and gives it to me, “Loy probably has challenged you earlier,” Loy looks accomplished, “Go outside and battle. I’ll tell you two when to stop.”\n\t“Yeah!” shouts Loy.\n\n\tWe stand outside by the side of South Lake. I think about Trustina, I remember she found the Codex of Water at the bottom of a lake, it may not be this or the north one, but it reminds me of her. I see a quiver under Loy’s cloak, he is on the other side of the forest opening. He draws his bow. With a single knife, I am at a clear disadvantage, but I have Trustina’s wand in case I need it. I try my best to remember the spell she used.\n\t“Byld Na Gly Laten Lux”\n\tThat was the spell she used that summoned the icy sword. It would be risky because I am inexperienced with magic, but it is my best chance of beating Loy. I hold the knife tightly in my right hand, Loy and Summer are currently unaware of the wand.\n\t“The battle will last until I say stop,” Summer announces, “This will probably be when a person gets too hurt. Any weapon you have is acceptable in this battle.”\n“Does she know about the wand or does Loy have another weapon?” I ask myself. I look at the sky and I see a sunless sunset. The floating network called the “Crescent” casts a large shadow along the lake and beyond.\n\t“Three,” Summer starts counting down, “Two,” I adjust my stance, “One,” Loy smirks at me, “Go!”\n\tLoy starts by launching an arrow, it misses but is surprisingly accurate. He reaches for another arrow. In this time, I decide to run at him with the knife in one hand, the other ready to grab the wand. I am about a dozen meters away from him when he loads and fires another arrow. The arrow would have hit me, but I deflect it with the knife.\n“Stand still!” he yells.\n“Nope!” I reply with.\nKnowing how long it took him to reload last time, I predict that I have enough time to cast the spell. To ensure I have a sufficient amount of time, I throw the knife at him, which misses, but distracts him.\n“Why did you throw out your weapon?” he asks. I ignore him and quickly reveal the wand. I close my eyes and speak the incantation.\n“Byld Na Gly Laten Lux”\n\tThe frost sword appears before me, the next arrow strikes it. I put the wand away. I hold the sword firmly with both of my hands and charge. Loy stares at me with a surprised face and Summer just laughs. When I am a few meters away from him, he quickly fires an arrow that stabs my left leg. I fall. He runs around me while loading the next arrow.\n\t“When did you learn magic?” he asks, starting a new conversation.\n\t“Before I met you,” I complete it.\n\tThe knife I threw earlier is laying on the ground. This scene seems familiar to me. I put down the ice sword and kick the knife towards my hand with my right leg. I hear the sound of an arrow piercing through the air, I turn around and block it with the knife. I remember that the ice sword can freeze someone when it makes contact and a risky idea comes to me.\n\tI push myself to stand up and grasp the sword. Loy is not far in front of me with his bow. As he is about the fire, I hold the sword above my head and throw it down to his feet. The ice shatters and shards of it fly everywhere. Some of it must have made contact with him because he drops down with the ice. I walk up to him with the knife.\n\t“Checkmate,” I say, the knife pointed at him.\n\t“Stop!” Summer shouts, “The winner of this duel is Dagel! Withdraw your weapons and please properly introduce yourselves to each other.” She looks like she has something planned. Loy starts moving again, he gets up and congratulates me.\n\t“Nice fight,” he says.\n\t“You too,” I reply with proper etiquette.\n\t“I did not expect you to use a magic weapon.”\n\t“Introduce yourselves already!” Summer says laughing. She seems to be pushing something.\n\t“My name is Dagel,” I start, but I do not have anything else to say.\n\t“My name is Loy,” he bows, “I use physical combat. I represent the relic hunters of the Ranged Weapon Class.” First, I do not understand what he is saying, but then I realize that he said he is a relic hunter, like Trustina.\n\t“A relic hunter?” I ask.\n\t“Relic hunters, as you may already know, search the Plane for relics the Creator might have left,” Summer explains, “We think that there is a relic for each main element of magical combat and class of physical combat. Follow me back to the camp, it is almost nighttime.”\n\n\tSummer leads Loy and I back to the camp, it is illuminated by lamps suspended on posts. The sky is a pinkish-orange color, sunset, I stare at the sky, the Ring is not far from aligning with the Exo-Plane. Summer brings us to a large tent in the central belt of tents. Inside it, there are two sleeping bags, lanterns, and backpacks.\n\t“Do not touch anything,” Summer tells us. She picks up a lantern and hands it to Loy, “Loy, you should get home soon.”\n\t“Right,” he gets out of the tent and runs towards the lake.\n\t“Because you are new here, you can stay at my place for tonight.” I walk just outside the tent and stare at the Ring. I sit down on the green grass.\n\t“Can you explain to me how the ‘classes’ of physical combat work?” I say without looking towards her. She comes outside and takes a seat next to me.\n\t“The Creator was a genius,” she starts, “They came up with five classes and many subclasses of physical combat to go along with the system of magic. These classes are often associated with weapons. People on the Plane designed names to go along with the classes the Creator made. My class, is the dagger or knife class, they call the Throwing Weapon class. The class Loy is in, consists of bows and guns, we call that Ranged. The group for axes and swords is called the Swinging Weapon class, and the spear or lance class is known as the Striking Weapons class.”\n\t“What is the last one?”\n\t“It is the Locking Class, often neglected because the weapons are hard to use. The Lock is identified with either a trident or scythe. In this world, you are either magical or physical, there is no inbetween.” The world blinks, light and dark, then the sky becomes suddenly black. The world around me is only perceivable because of the lights around me.\n\t“What just happened?”\n\t“The Ring just shut down,” Summer laughs, “The night cycle has begun. Come back inside the tent.” We go inside the tent. “As I was saying, you can choose one type of combat or the other. Then after that, you have a class, subclasses, element or a sub-element.”\n\t“Gly, Shatters, Cast, Murat, Lux, Strike, Range, Throw, Swing, or Lock,” I repeat from my memory.\n\t“If you are going to live on the Plane, you have to choose one,” she looks at me, “Which subsection do you choose?” I remember how I used both physical and magical combat in the battle with Loy. \n\t“Can I choose both physical and magical?”\n\t“No,” she looks furious, “It doesn’t work that way in this world! Just go to sleep, maybe you will think of something overnight.” I crawl into one of the sleeping bags, today has been a very astonishing day. I had been transported into a new world for an unknown reason, with magic and floating objects. I had learned many different things about this new world, about the Sky Marks and the Plane, the Magic and relics, the weapons and classes. I will have to process this information overnight.\n\t“The Strike include weapons that pierce the opponents, the Range are weapons that attack from afar, the Swing are weapons that harm by slicing the opponent, the Throw have weapons that are launched at the opponent with the risk of getting loss, and the Lock use weapons to trap the opponent in many ways.”\n“Go to sleep!” Summer sounds annoyed, “Good night!”\nThen I remember Night, who seems so emotionless. She feels like a dying life that witnessed the destruction of others. She teaches others about magic and searches for a meaning to everything. Trustina, the girl who always seems so happy, like a puppy who has yet to get run over by unexpected events. Loy, he is a challenging and brave person. He seems like he will prove something important one day. And Summer, warm like her name but may cause destruction with blindness and enthusiasm.\n“I do not care,” I whisper behind Summer, “I will stay with undetermined combat, and I will find the meaning to this world. Good night.”\n\n\t“Are you awake?” A blurred voice says, it reminds me of Summer, but I know it is not. It it strict and cold in a disturbing way, “Wake up Dagel!” I open my eyes and see nothing. Darkness everywhere, I blink repeatedly to make certain I am not imagining things. It feels like a dream, it is a dream, but why?\n\tThe world suddenly becomes bright, I am alone in a small room with a bed and dresser. Outside a window, I see a city with a red atmosphere. I know I am not on the Plane. I look at a hand mirror on the dresser, my reflected image is the face of Night. I am stuck in here, a prison of the world I cannot get to in real life.\n\t“You will die,” a familiar voice says different from the first one, “There is no avoiding it.” It is the voice of the mysterious swordsman, the one Loy and I saw in the woods.\n\t“Who are you?” I ask, but it only appears in a monotone voice. I see the mysterious swordsman appear.\n\t“Hello, my fair maiden Night,” he says. I feel uncomfortable. An outcry builds up inside me. Then I hear a high-pitched voice screech endlessly. I fall to the ground, panicking.\n\t“Why?” I hear a raspy voice say inside me. The screech only gets worse. I cover my ears tightly with my hands. My throat starts to hurt. I cough blood.\n\t“You are dying, my friend,” the first, cold voice states. My heart starts to hurt. I cannot breathe. My lungs feel tight, I feel my chest collapse in on itself. My vision goes black, but I can still hear.\n\t“Stop!” I hear the mysterious swordsman say.\n\t“Good bye!,” the cold voice says. I hear a scream from the mysterious swordsman. “Hello Night, do you need assistance?”\n\t“Unnecessary,” I say before the dream ends. The world goes black.\n\n\tI wake up, and find myself in the tent. Summer doesn’t seems to be around. The lanterns have been extinguished. I feel something on my leg.\n\t“Are you awake?” I hear a bland voice ask. It must be Night. I sit up.\n\t“What are you doing?” She is sitting on my leg writing in a notebook with runes on the cover.\n\t“I was waiting for you to wake up,” the plain voice says.\n\t“Where is Summer?”\n\t“She had went out to explore,” she stares at me, “I wanted to request something from you.”\n\t“What do you need?” She passes me a similar notebook and quill.\n\t“Keep a journal and documents the events of your life here on the Plane. Your appearance here is abnormal, so you may have meaning,” stare, “My purpose is to find a meaning to this world. Everyone else had settled down and live their lives on the Plane, but I need to find the reason Creator had brought us all here.” I wonder about this world too.\n\t“Do you know anything else about the Plane that you haven’t told me yet?”\n\t“Yes, the Crescent is perfectly accessible to everyone, the Exo-Plane however, is risky to make contact with, as it only touches our Ring once a year. Many people have stood on the Exo-Plane, but no one stays there. The Ring, however is popular, there is an entire city on the peak of the Ring. Other than that, the Other Side has been completely isolated from us. No one has ever been to the Other Side.”\n\t“When will the Other Side appear again?”\n\t“In about a week, I am planning to visit it to study the Sky Marks.” I think to myself, if someone stays on the Other Side, do they disappear with it when the Sky Marks unalign?\n\t“Do you think it is possible that the Other Side is connected to Earth?”\n\t“Very likely, we do not know where the Other Side goes when the Sky Marks are not aligned.”\n\t“If you are going to the Other Side, I will come along with you.” She stares.\n\t“Okay then, you may be the key we need to unlock the secrets of the Plane,” her serious face stills, “Let us find Trustina and Loy.”\n\tShe walks me to the blacksmith building. The path from the tent to it is very short. When we enter it, I see Loy looking at a shield hanging on the gray, brick wall. I think about the shield and armor, what class of the physical combat do they belong in?\n\t“Hello Loy,” the monotone says, “Where is Trustina?”\n\t“I think Trustina is back at the Rootbased village,” he turns around, “Why do you need her?”\n\t“I was going to talk to Trustina about something,” she stares at Loy.\n\t“Can I join?”\n\t“Yes,” the unenthusiastic voice says.\n\tAfter Loy tags along, Night brings us to the Rootbased village, built on the roots of the Colossus. I feel a familiar path, as we walk down a path of stones. We climb the stairs of wooden plank, and navigate through a maze of houses. The floor, polished stone, like the day before. When we reach the end of the village, I see it. The Observatory tower perched upon the hill accessible by bridge. We cross the bridge, and into the stone brick tower.\n\t“Hello!” Trustina smiles, she is sitting down on the dusty ground. The blue magic orb from yesterday is still there.\n\t“Hello,” Night says with her personality. I think that Night has guided us to Trustina to bring them on the way to the Other Side.\n\t“Are you planning on bringing them?” I ask Night.\n\t“I am not, but i know you are planning to.”\n\t“Bring us to what?” Loy asks behind us. I look at Night and she nods, but all I can see in her face is the pain I felt in dream from earlier.\n\t“Night plans on traveling to the Other Side,” I look at her again for confirmation. She just stares, “Do you want to come with us?”\n\t“Yeah!” Loy and Trustina yell in unison blissfully.\n\t“Then we shall start soon.”\n\n\tNight gives me the rest of the day to adjust to the Plane by myself, meanwhile, she prepares for the trip. I am alone outside the Observatory tower, as Loy and Trustina went off with Night. I look at the old structure, vines have grown on the bricks of it, and the bricks themselves seem worn. The small hill it is perched upon is covered in green grass. I enter the building.\n\tThe floor of it is made of old, wooden planks, they creak as I walk. The highlight of this room is the blue orb that produces the magenta haze. The transparent orb is floating upon the wooden table. Something I have not noticed before, candles, are rotating in the area above the orb. I climb up the ladder, which is fine and sanded.\n\tI take a look on the floor where Trustina fought me, this is where I first used magic. The bookshelves still exist, with the table and chair. I still have the wand, but I had forgotten most of the spells I had witnessed. I grab a golden-bordered book from the bookshelves. It is filled with unfamiliar words. I skim through it and notice a pattern. Some words seem to be very common.\n\t“Lux, Shatters, Gly, Cast, Murat”\n\tI recognize them as the five elements of the Plane.\n\t“Darkness and Water,” I say aloud, even though no one is here, “I think Lux means light, but what is Cast and Murat?”\n\t“Murat, element of wind. Allied with Gly and Shatters,” a voice says behind it. It whispers, “Cast element of fire. Allied with Lux and Shatters.”\n\t“Who are you?” I ask, turning around. No one is behind me. I decide to get out of the Observatory tower.\n\tAfter running around the bridge, I feel safe again. The voice reminded me of the dream I had, even though I know the voice is not from it. I decide to go into the Colossus.\n\tThe huge tree towers over the world, creating a shade away from the Plane across a large distance. I remember what Trustina told me about the Crescent. The only way to get there is by climbing to the top of the Colossus and jumping onto it.\n\tI walk through the arch that opens the large tree. The network of bridges and platforms still awes me. Recalling my path from yesterday, I navigate through the jungle of platforms. I watch a floating torch as it follows me.\n\t“Dagel!” I hear an enthusiastic shout. It must be Summer. I turn around and see her running to me, “Why are you alone?”\n\t“Night told me to adjust to the Plane while she prepares with Trustina and Loy.”\n\t“Prepare for what?” she says while laughing.\n\t“She plans to get to the Exo-Plane to find the meaning about the Plane.”\n\t“Oh, that sounds so much like her,” she looks bothered, “I’m going to have to talk to her about that. Maybe I can join her.” she starts running up the spiral staircase to the entrance of Night’s stone palace.\n\t“Good luck!” I shout.\n\t“Thanks!” I continue with my day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n\tWhen we meet again, the Ring cascades down onto the flat world with a red-ish hue. I am heading back to the camp\n",
//  "Wish\n\tLife has a value. Whenever I have walked down the dirty streets with my sister, September, and made eye contact with strangers, I could see numbers in their eyes. The number was always in a language I could not understand, but I knew it was big. When I look into the eyes of someone I know like Em or my older sister, that number would be bigger.\n\n~\n\n\tMany people in the world are useless. Unless they are my family or a person who works for us, a person does not matter. For an unknown cause, everybody has a value in front of their chest. This is a value only I can see, and I understand it even though it appears to be glyphs that are not numerals. Everybody I live with has a significant value, and everybody else has a low value. Dr. Bree says it may be a psychological thing.\n\n1 Jayce\n\nSeptember is dying. Her leg is hurt so I have to carry her while I run through the rain and the polluted street. When I reach a corner, Em and I hide from the dangerous people. Em soaked, breathes heavily.\n“We, need to, keep running!” he whispers with many inhales between every few words.\n“No,” I tell him, “I’m too tired. I don’t think the bad guys are still following us.”\nI peek around the corner, it looks like the dangerous people stopped following us. I look at September, she is tightly holding the bread that she took from the people.\n“We should go back now, before they come back,” I tell Em. Looking forward, I take steps.\n“No! Jay-” Em wasn’t able to finish his sentence.\nI am tackled when I turn around to look at Em. I lose hold of September and fall into floor trash. A heavy body pins me down.\n“Let me go!” I yell at the person.\nI don’t know where Em went. I can see my sister on the floor, still hugging food. I want to move, but a person won’t let me. Bad people are walking to her. One guy has a knife. September looks at me, but I can’t do anything. The scary people hurt her.\n\t“This is what you deserve for taking our dinner!” the scary man yells and kicks the food away from her and into mud.\n\tI can see September struggling, trying to grab the bread. We don’t even want it anymore. She should be trying to run, not trying to feed us.\n\n\tThe rain stops. After a few minutes, September is red and isn’t moving. The bad people get off us and go away. I see Em on the floor, but I run to September, Em isn’t bloody.\n\tI pick September up and she shares the red color.\n\t“September?” I say. She still has the number in her eyes. She smiles. I watch the number as it fades away from her pupils. She closes her eyes, but never opens them again.\nI wait.\n“September?” I ask again. I can’t see the number if she doesn’t open her eyes. I slowly let go of my sister and look around. Nobody is here except Em, who is crying. Then, I notice a strange thing in my hands. It is the number that I always see in September. I feel as if this number represents September, and so I tell her.\n“I want to survive. I will survive with Em until something else kills me. I will be the one to kill myself, if it won’t be those bad people who kill me.”\nThe number on my hand disappears.\n\n\n\n\nI have always lived with September in the streets of this city. Since birth, my parents had neglected me, seeing me as a problem. To remove this problem, I was eliminated singly, but September decided to take care of me as the girl she was. After finding a way of living, we meet Em. He was a kid that we knew as the one that lives in that one home. He would always stay out with us like a friend. If we were really lucky, he would bring bread or some scraps of food to us in the night. September and I were not wealthy at all, I do not think I could repay her or Em.\n\n\tI wake up again without September. I think it was two days since she died, but I am not sure because of how long it felt. It was very hard to choose what to do. I stayed by where she was for an hour or two, then Em had told me to leave. I didn’t want to. Eventually, the cold night told me to find a place to sleep. I was forced to leave my sister because it was too much to carry. In a city like this, no one cares if you die. My sister’s body disappeared, I don’t know what happened to it. The next day, I hadn’t eaten much. I was too busy being sad. Even Em tried to help me. He asked his parents if he could give me food and a place to be for a while. They gave me food, but said no to living in the house.\n\t“Stealing is bad,” Em, who is next to me, says. I don’t respond. “Maybe you should find a safer way to get food.” I eat some of the shreds of meat Em provided me with. Em is a nice person, he would give me food even when he and his family can barely survive. “I heard that in some places, people have so much food that they throw half of it away.”\n\t“I would like to be there. Maybe I can live off of looking through trash.” We both laugh lightly.\n\t“Jayce, do you know where your parents lived?”\n\t“No,” I answer, “I was too little to remember their faces. My sister always told me that they are dead.”\n\t“Sorry,” he sounds really disappointed, “I was thinking that you could return to them and help them. Maybe work and earn money.”\n\t“Even if they were stive alive and I knew their names, I don’t want to work. It’s too dangerous.”\n\t“Oh yeah, my dad tells me that people in factories can cut their fingers off if they don’t pay watch. In the farms, people are hurt if they do their jobs wrong.”\n\t“It was wrong to steal. People worked for the food we took.” Em attempts to interrupt me, but I stop him. “September was wrong but she was trying to keep me alive.”\n\tEm looks really sad, I wish I could help him and everyone else in the world.\n\t“Hey Em,” I begin, “What happens when a person dies?”\n\t“My dad told me that they go into a world where they don’t have to worry about food.”\n\t“September tells me that a place like that isn’t a thing.”\n\n2 Flora\n\n\tNobody in our dear house understood the crisis we resided in. When I heard that somebody had breached the strengthened security of this mansion, my instinct was to go find mother. I would have shivered still under the ever-changing, frozen light of my bedroom, but the drive of being with a loved one has pierced every possible boundary in history. Not a single person was shuttling between the halls of my castle and the chill of the exterior rainy weather made the scene more ominous. For if the intruder appears before me, I will resist against them.\n\tI begin to hear a graceful chide as I approach my parents’ room. Something is incorrect in this situation. Mother would not sing if she knows a dangerous being can hear her, yet mother releases a call we all know too well. I run into mother’s room.\n\t“Flora, you have come for me,” she says with a smile. She is sitting on her bed writing on a paper with a blue pen. A luminescence above is illuminating the entire room. I look at her, the value that represents her glows by her clothes, near her chest. The value is as high as always.\n\t“Are you well?” I ask her. She continues to sing.\n\t“Why would I not be well?” she responds in peace, like a ripple of motion in shallow water.\n\t“There is an intruder! You should be quiet and dim the lights!” I say softly, yet sharply.\n\t“If that is true, would that suggest that you should be in your personal area?” she is correct, which is why I stay silent. “I have faith in our security, even if I am endangering myself, it will bring attention away from you and father, speaking of which, is in the study.”\n\n\tThe next hour was brimmed with risk and regret. Believing my mother, I headed to the study and ensured that father was safe. Afterwards, I followed the path back to my mother’s room. She was found by the enemy and wounded. A red nectar flowing from what I believe is an honorable queen.\n\t“Mother!” I yell for her. “Tell me what occured while I was absent.”\n\t“Flora,” she starts, “The person who is foreign to this residence will be apprehended soon.” While she is still alive, I call for help. Nobody is nearby in this warming world. I can sense that my mother planned this. My decision was to whether leave my mother for help or to stay with my mother until the end. If this was a real-life game of chess played by my mother, this entire sequence of events was determined before it even started. I stay with my mother.\n\n\t“Did I do well?” I finally ask her.\n\t“Yes.” Dawn is beginning when I watch a disappearance. The arbitrary font of the number on my mother does not change anything, I understand what it means to the fullest. I can count to twenty-five in the span of when the number starts to fade and when it is gone. Neither the two people in this room speak in this event. The value opens its eyes in the palm of my right hand. Mother is with me.\n\t“I wish I could find and take down the group of people who killed you.”\n\tHearing my wish, the number begins to sleep, and goes away.\n\n\n\n\tThe infiltrators have been caught almost immediately after I found my mother. Supporters of protection had found me in the crowned room that belongs to my mother. When the area of my home was declared safe, I treaded to father’s den once again. I told him of  everything I had witnessed. Afterwards, I finally ended up in my own bedroom again and substituted the rest I was to earn the night we were invaded.\n\t\n\tSunshine pierces through the gates of window panes and settles on the illustrious blue embedded in my sheets. So much had happened only hours ago, yet my eyes greet me with a traditional mood. The situation almost feels as if I had a nightmare.\n\t“Good afternoon Miss Flora,” Minna says with a bow. In her arms, clothes wait for me like the moon does before it shines. Her long brown hair falls to her shoulder, onto the clothes of a theme I title,  The Dance of Zebra.\n\t“Hello.” I remove the blankets which mask my legs and exit the mattress to the side Minna is at. She follows me as I head to a round mirror slightly greater than my height. Along with a metal frame, this object depicts me every time I stare at it. Minna begins to dress me. She stays quiet, clearly avoiding a topic.\n\t“Minna, what will happen to mother’s body?” She ignores my question with a grace.\n\t“Miss Flora, your father is waiting for you in the dining area.”\n\tWhen I look at my mirrored image, I see a damaged person. This person who was courageous enough to hunt through early morning, but left a person to die. In that case, why would my mother allow herself to be hurt? She is a genius, capable of tying a string between a hunter and the hunted. This person born poor, figured out how the gears of a society turn and used it to become honored. My mother must have had a reason to die; that fortune teller knows the future until a century later.\n\t“Minna, what time is it?”\n\t“It should be seventeen before eleven.”\n\tAfter Minna completed her task, she guided me through the enormous halls of the place I lived. The status of my family is only possible with what we are currently missing. The area I am to eat is only a couple rooms away from my den. Down the corridor, to a sharp right. There, my meal and my father awaits.\n\t“Good afternoon Flora,” he says with his fingers intertwined.\n\n\tIt was a challenging task. Father and I discussed how to handle the situation for the next week. He decided that it would be fair if I were to stay hidden the entire time. Without my mother, the palace of swans sink to an abyss of serpents. He would take care of everything related to public information.\n\n\tShe was poor as a child, her family lived in the slums. They would have nothing to eat for many days, and when they did the food was dirt. She had a motivation nobody else had. Inspired by the skilled and rich, she become studious. The healthy lifestyle earned her an ability that was unique. She could calculate the future, and used that to pull her parents from poverty. Unfortunately, they did not live for long. My mother started several businesses and instantly grew in power. Along with fame came danger, and so she is gone.\n\n\tMinna would accompany me for the next days. I decide on a task that would entrance me for a while.\n\t“Minna, bring me thread,”  I command.\n\t“Yes,” she says as she rushes out the room.\n\n3 Jayce\n\t\n\tIt is night…\n\n\tWhen I come to, I am lying in a grayish water under a bridge. I wobble over to the sunlight. The sky is cloudy and the floor is wet. The first thing I think of is September.\n\tWhere is she? Is she out looking for food?\n\tI feel hurt when I remember that my sister is dead. She died trying to feed us and so now, I am alone.\n\n\tI walk through the street where I last saw September. The street to the left is where the people we last stole from are. I hear the funny sound of worn shoes and wet cement against each other. I see Em is slightly running to me with his arms around something wrapped in cloth.\n\t“Hey Jayce! I have something for you!” he laughs.\n\t“What is it?” I look at his arms.\n\t“It’s leftovers of a chicken,” he unwraps the food, “Papa found a bird wandering around the farm before. Take some.” He gives me a piece.\n\t“Thank you Em.” I tilt my head towards him in a bow. I take the meat and put it in my mouth. We start to walk down the street.\n\t“Are you doing okay by yourself?” he asks.\n\t“Yeah.”\n\t“I think I have a place for you to stay. My uncle has this shed that he isn’t using. Maybe you can sleep there.”\n\t“I will have to think about that.”\n\tI hear heavy footsteps behind me. “Hey!” an mad voice shouts. When I turn around, I see the person from several days ago, the person that killed September.\nShould I be angry that September died? My sister and I were bad people, we stole from everyone for food and were almost never punished. I don’t want to believe that we deserved to be hurt, but the starving man may have been justified in it.\nEm does not agree. When he sees the man, he holds his fists tightly. In seconds, he is already charging a punch while sprinting to his enemy. The man is thrown back and falls on the hard concrete. Em stands above him and begins to give a fury of weaker punches.\n“Get off me you rat!” the man yells.\n“You killed September!” Em shrieks.\n“Stop it Em,” I run to them and attempt to life Em away.\n\t“Why?” he is mad at me, “He killed your sister and should be punished! Don’t you want to take her back?”\n\tThe man pulls a knife out of his pocket. It shines in the little sunlight that passes the clouds. Em reacts in time to dodge a hit. I step back.\n\t“Hurting a person will not save who is already dead.”\n\t“How would you know?” Em screams with danger in his eyes, “Why is it so hard to live in this world?”\n\tAfter evading another attack, Em twists while quickly raising his right leg. With it, he knocks the blade out of the man’s hand using a power he shouldn’t have. The knife is launched many meters to the left, scraping the floor when it lands.\n\tA familiar voice tells me, “People are stronger when a person they care about is in danger.” The voice is everywhere, and nowhere; I cannot find the source.\n\tBy the time I look back up, Em has the knife in his hand and is hurting the man. I run as fast as I can and push Em away. “Stop it!” He drops the weapon at looking guilty. The person stands up and stumbles for a bit, only to collapse on the ground. I go over and assist him. He already has too many cuts to count, one slice at a vital area.\n“Where do you need to go?” I ask him.\n“Kid, stop trying. You can leave me alone. I’m fine.”\nWhen I glance at his face, his eyes hold a number in an unrecognizable font. I don’t understand why, but I have the feeling that it is less than September’s yet very high. The number is already fading. Maybe like my sister was, he is close to death. I can tell when he is gone, the weight carrying him becomes heavier as if the body stopped trying to stand upright. I slowly drop him, only to find that the number of him appeared in my hands.\nI look back at Em and the knife beside him, covered in blood.\nI say to him, “I wish every weapon would just disappear.”\n\tAt that moment, a miracle happens. I feel the world becoming peaceful, like the feeling of completing a difficult task. Stars begin dancing, from everywhere in the city at to the horizon upwards into the sky. The sparkles glow brightly and become the greater sun behind the clouds. I can see one before me; the weapon at Em’s feet shatters and decays, erasing itself from this world. What is left behind is a group of lights like the others, which float upwards like a helium balloon. The number on my hand follows along with the global luminescence.\n\tEvery weapon just disappeared.\n\n4 Flora\n\n\tIt is happening again. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJayce\n\n\tAt final, my vision collides with hers. It was only a month since we have lost our humanity, yet the experience feels like a century. Nonchalantly, I progress to the suffering soul which had been granted what nobody should have.\nThere is a point where everything has a limit, because everything can be judged.\nFlora with defeat, stands and sways, rattled. She drops the knife. Her eyes are closed as if they reflected her regret.\nA person could hear if they are blind, but a person cannot hear if they have not experienced tranquility.\nI recall the diligence of her mother, and how she would always carefully decide on her moves. I decide on a move and release the gates of my words.\n“Flora. Checkmate.”\nSuddenly, her eyes open, like a butterfly fleeing from a cocoon. Crying, she denies the effort she had resisting gravity. She speaks no words nor sounds. Flora gradually drifts away from consciousness, still awake.\nEntropy, the universe seeks balance.\n“We never had any power. The wishes were an illusion. Every wish we had made was countered by the universe.”\nI recall the seventh law of wishes.\nFor the wishes to end, either both wishmakers must die or a wishmaker makes wish for an end.\nA universe where two beings of control abruptly disappear would greatly disturb the world. Yet, after the experiments that were performed on my being, everybody had less of potential. I cannot find anybody to match the level of a wish that would end it all. Even Flora, who is sprawled on the dusty ground beneath me, does not match that requirement.\n“You,” croaks Flora. It was an abstract message. The voice was not aggressive, but it was trying to inform me of something. This was a wolf who warns the elk. I did not understand the realization Flora had. She moans again, “I have many regrets, so I cannot do it.”\nThe body that you move is the only body you can move.\nThe epiphany was exponential.\nOf the billions of people in the world, there is only one you need to keep living.\nI believe I see the monster behind me.\nKindness is greed in disguise.\nWhy would the scorpion feed its foe?\nI tread to Flora, lifting my hand as if I were raising a sword.\nTwo people are starving with nothing else to eat within kilometers. How did one survive?\nAfter moving right foot after left foot, I elevate the weapon Flora had brought.\nEvery human only cares about themself.\n“Every human only cares about themself.” I say to my friend on the ground. She smiles. I look at my reflection in the knife. Surely, the number in my eyes only say a symbol I can recognize, the lemniscate. I take a deep breath and think about everything that happened after September’s death. I look at Flora one last time, “Thank you. Meeting you taught me something. I really wish that the wishes did not change our lives so drastically.” With that final quotation, I raise the knife.\n\nLife has a value. That value cannot be measured.\n",
//  "Serenity - Chapter 1\n\n\tIt really is not obvious at first, but you can see that the grains of sand can actually be entire galaxies with worlds in of them. In this world, Apram, we have a strange group of creatures, things you would consider “people.” These things are the Taw, in many similar yet different species, all of them are born with some skills. These four skills are: Potential, the physical strength a person has; Influence, the magical capabilities of a Taw; Comprehension, a Taw’s ability to understand current events and history; and Function, the mobility and agility they carry. These skills have a specific value to them and are expensive to check. If you had a score of zero in a skill, that could never be changed, known as Ciphers. Along with that, there are four living characteristics that we all have: Wellness, Resistance, Fame, and Attraction. Unlike skills, the score of these could always be observed as long as the Taw is alive. These eight ideas are called attributes, and can determine everything about a Taw’s life.\n\tAll Taw are born with at least two skills and the rest are Ciphers. Only really fortunate Taw have all four skills, allowing them to become successful in their life. As long as you put effort into increasing the score of skills you have, you can live a good life.\nAnybody could do it. Everyone is born with a skill.\nEverybody, except me.\n\nThe only attribute of a high score I have is Attraction, the attention of monsters. Because I only have Ciphers, if a monster approaches me, I have not strength to fight back. I cannot use magic or run quickly. I can’t even remember the history of this world. I can only survive.\nFour guards surround me, like the corners of a blanket. These Taw are wearing clothing created from monster pelt. I can sense that their Potential attribute was high, so I cannot flee if I tired. I try to concentrate on the coarse ground below me as I walk on it barefoot with no clothing. The path is ruined and dusty, gifting pain every time my feet contact it. The guards decide to have an insulting conversation about me in my presence.\n“How dangerous can this dumb Cipher be?” the Taw ahead to the right of me asks. Cipher is an insult to a person with undeveloped skills, directly named after a Cipher Skill.\n“Kid has a super high Attraction and all zeros,” a deeper voice from my left behind says.\n“Won’t we be helping the world if we were to kill him now?” the first Taw speaks.\n“The King told us to keep him unharmed,” a quiet line emits from ahead of me. The person on my left continues, “If you were to scar our subject, we would be punished.” The two others stay silent.\n\nNot so long later, I am in front of many civilians. The people are my kind, the Faw with two sharp teeth extending from the neck, the Aureole. The crowd is scared of me, their faces like burns on my already-diminished confidence. The guards from earlier have joined with lines of other defenders separating me from the villagers, now with spears. I am in a castle created by magic, something I would have never experienced with my parents. The gray, brick walls stack up to a ceiling higher than the trunk of a large tree. The area is illuminated of wispy fires, generated through this mean of magic. On a stage higher than the many Taw in the room, a monarch’s family rests in thrones to judge me. They frown at me with spears of vision. I look towards my bare feet, avoiding eye contact.\n“Monster Bringer,” the Queen identifies me with shock in her breath.\n“I was born with this trait!” I yell at them, fiercely. “I have no control over my attributes!”\n“Execute this dangerous toxin,” the King says, between a smile and a worried face. It oozes a disbelief, but is filled with content.\nWhen I look around, the Aureole guards march towards me with the weapons aimed at me, synchronized, right foot forward, then left foot forward. Soon, they are only feet away from my position.\n",
//  "\nPRESENT - I\n\n\tFor as long as I recall, I existed in a locked room. This room has no furniture, no entrance or exit. There was no such thing as wallpaper or boarding. This room was bland, and there was no light. That is, there was no light except from through a window. I was alone in the room, but I had company. Through the window was another room; it was similar to mine. Just like me, a person rested in this room. She was the only person I knew, and the only person she knew was me.\n\n\nPARTITION:\nDEMARCATE\n\n\nNINE YEARS BEFORE PRESENT - II\n\n\t“Hey,” I say to her, “Wake up.” She is lying on the floor, in the same clothes she is always in. She holds her eyelids closed tightly while her arm moves, then she opens them.\n\t“Huh?” she rubs her eyes and sits up, “Good morning.”\n\n\tSleeping is a strange thing. I always remember waking up, but I never remember going to sleep. I have never seen her sleep, and she has never seen me sleep. We have tried to force ourselves to stay conscious before, but we always forget what happens. This is the time when Delivers happen. Waking up to new objects in the room, just for them to disappear the next time we wake up. It is always a surprise: this being very odd. We have never seen the end of a Session of Consciousness, only the beginning.\n\n\tThrough the thick pane that separates us, I ask her, “What is the Deliver?”\n\tShe reaches towards the side of the wall I cannot see, “This looks like a cube.” She holds it up, it is a green, painted wooden block the size of her hands. “Do you have anything?” she asks.\n\t“Only my journal and a pen,” I respond. I flip to the newest page and write a new entry for tosession’s Deliver.\n\n\tThe journal is a strange object. It never disappears and it never dies. I can tear the journal one Session, and the next will have it repaired. The pen never runs out of ink, and the journal never runs out of pages. If I were to flip to the end of the journal, I would end up in the middle. Opening it backwards does not help either, for that I open to a page at the beginning. Marking every page differently is also useless, because no matter how many I mark, I never reach the end. I have never questioned the journal just like I never questioned sleeping.\n\n\t“Is the cube marked in any way?” I ask\n\t“Nope, it just looks like a paint-coated block.”\n“A cube is a six-sided polyhedron. It has eight corners and is constructed of regular quadrilaterals.”\n“That sounds correct.” I take notes of myself in my journal.\n\n\tKnowledge is abstract in this realm. Confined to two rooms, there is no area to learn anything new, but I manage to know everything about anything that comes from Delivers. I do not know where I learned things, I just know them. I write everything I remember down, because forgetting seems very common here.\n\n\tI do not remember how much time we spent talking about that, or the cube. It may have been an eternity, but we did it until the end of that Session.\n\n\nSEVEN YEARS BEFORE PRESENT - III\n\n\t“Hey,” I hear banging vibrations from the still window that separates us, “Wake up!” This time, she is the one to wake me up.\n\tI slowly open my eyes to see the same light that I lived under years ago. I prop myself up and look at her.\n\n\tShe has no name. She has no date of birth. She has no experience of the places outside these rooms. She is just like me. I know her for that.\n\n\t“Good morning,” that is the phrase that became instinct over the time we spent here. Tosession, the Deliver is on my side of the world. I reach for one of two small objects, the length of my palm, against the wall with the window. It is a black box made of a soft material, with a division across a horizontal plane. I hold it up to her.\n\t“That looks like a box,” she says. “Is it a ring?”\n\t“Yes,” I say as I open it to find a metal loop tipped with a gem. “Wait a while,” I say to her as I take my journal and write a new entry in it. She is leaning against the window with two palms pressed against the glass.\n\t“Isn’t a ring a symbol of love?”\n\t“I believe so,” I write that in my notes, “People use it to show a relationship.”\n\t“Will we ever experience a relationship?” she questions, smiling.\n\t“I do not understand love,” I tell her, “It seems odd.”\n\t“Well, on Earth, it isn’t.”\n\n\tEarth is a mysterious place. We know the history of humans, life, and its solar system, but we have never seen it. We have more knowledge of it than the average person on it would have, though we have never been there. It is as if we were from there.\n\n\t“Do you think Earth exists?” I ask her.\n\t“I want to say so, but it is strange to believe,” she responds.\n\t“Where does our knowledge come from?”\n\t“It must come from there.”\n“It must come from there,” I repeat. I stare at her, and she stares at me. She stares at me, I stare at her.\n“Can I say that I love you?”\n“I wish you could, but I do not know what that means.”\n\nWe did not realize it, but a gear started to turn.\n\nThat was a rare moment where we stood still. It was silence. She did not respond and I did not speak. I felt something as if the floor was collapsing, but it never did. She looked away and sat against the wall with the window. I did the same, knowing that I may never touch her.\n\t“I love you anyways,” she says.\n\t“I do too.”\n\tThe time that followed was short. I held the black box in my hands, crying. For the first time in my memory, I felt myself slowly drifting to a stable state; I was falling asleep. I know she did too.\n\nSEVEN YEARS BEFORE PRESENT - IV\n\n\tSomething is off. I wake up with a concentrated fear of something. I have a strange feeling I never had before; this feeling was an emptiness inside my body. Worried for her, I stand up and look through the window.\n\tThere is no window.\n\tWhere is the other room?\n\tI am in an area twice as large as the room I was in yestersession, as if our two rooms were joined by the removal of the wall. She is lying down on the other side of this space, in the same position she is always in.\n\tI try to ignore all the changes and run over to her. It feels alien, so I extend my forefinger and slowly approach her. It lands on the soft material she wears, so similar to mine. There is an unfamiliar aroma that is emitted from this body. I lay my two hands on her and gently rock her.\n\t“Hey, wake up.”\n\tOnce again, her eyelids lift and see sees. She looks at me, confused.\n\t“Hey,” she glances around, “Where am I?”\n\t“We are in the same room we have always been in,” I assume.\n\t“What happened to the wall?”\n\t“I am as confused as you are.”\n\tSuddenly, she starts to quiver.\n\tI ask her, “What is wrong?”\n\t“I remember what happened yestersession, I fell asleep.”\n\t“I recall that too, but at least the wall cannot separate us anymore.”\n\tThe sensation from earlier returns, and an emptiness roars from my body: hunger.\n\t“Do you feel it?” I ask her, “Hunger?”\n\t“No, I have this other feeling,” she binds her legs together, “Something inside me wants to leave.”\n\tWe have always relied on the system of Sessions to care for us. We never expected something like this to happen. Our bodies had no need for food, water, sleep, fitness, or waste removal. The End of Sessions always did those things for us, but now, we cannot depend on that.\n\t“Are you okay?”\n\t“Don’t worry about me, do we still have Delivers?”\n\tI had forgotten about such a thing as a result of noticing the missing wall. I look behind her, then behind me.\n\tBehind her are many objects, more than any Deliver has ever provided: a table with twelve water bottles with what looks like twelve plates of food, a sheet-covered rectangular prism with a length-width-height ratio of 3 to 2 to 1, and a strange white seat that I believe is a toilet. On my side, the two ring boxes and my journal and pen lie on the floor.\n\tShe looks at everything as well.\n\t“Is that food?” she points at the table.\n\t“I think so.”\n\tI stand up and head towards it to inspect it. From what I know, food is supposed to be eaten with silverware, but there is none. I look at one of the objects resting on the plate. There seems to be napkins next to it.\n\tThis is a burger.\n\t“Hey, come over here,” I tell her.\n\tShe stands keeping her legs together. Slowly, she shuttles towards the set and me. A liquid is flowing down to her feet.\n\t“What do I do?” she asks, worried.\n\t“Use the toilet.”\n\t“I don’t know how,” she cries.\n\t“Just use it. It is part of a deliver, so you will remember how to do it.”\n\tShe does.\n\n\nSEVEN YEARS BEFORE PRESENT - V\n\n\tIt was like that for a long time. Eventually, we had gotten used to the idea of sleeping and eating. We still had deliveries as usual, but they would always appear and disappear when we were not paying attention. Since there was one bed, we only slept one at a time; it was a cycle with three phases. They were: the time I would sleep, the time we would spend together, and the time she would sleep.\n\tHaving the ability to physically touch each other was interesting. We understood the ideas of manners through deliveries, but we did not have the necessity to follow them. The only two people in the world were us, so we did not care.\n\tTorn pages in the journal stayed torn, and harmed bodies would stay harmed. The deliveries brought us food and water, and took the waste away. The only things that stayed in the room were: the table, the toilet, a sink, the bed, a clock, the two rings from the day it started, and us. Sessions did not exist anymore, so I used the clock.\n\t\n\tEventually, directly referring to each other became a trouble, so we named each other. We took two relevant words from the journal. She called me Wish, and I called her Hope.\n\n\nSIX YEARS BEFORE PRESENT - VI\n\n\tToday’s Deliver was a Rubik’s cube. It was summoned at 7:30 AM in a solved state. The Rubik’s cube is a puzzle based off the three-dimensional solid, the cube. It has 43 quintillion different positions and six colors; it is constructed with 21 pieces and has 54 stickers.\n\t“Hey Hope, can I have the puzzle?” I ask with my hand extended.\n\t“Sure, I should eat anyways.”\n\tShe passes me the cube, scrambled. Using the knowledge I earn from Delivers, I solve it.\n\t“Wish,” she calls, “Why do you think we exist?” She eats salad.\n\n\tEver since we named each other, we started to question this world even more. I can only compare it to a prison cell, but with the Delivers, it is very possible that we are humans living between intergalactic space travel: used to keep the human race alive while we approach another world.\n\n\t“We might be travelers from Earth,” I tell her.\n\t“What if we are?”\n\t“Then we travel.” I take a plate of food and eat. She looks at her ring.\n\n\tThe pair of rings from a year ago were shared. She put on her ring, and I put on mine. Even though we never truly experienced it, we are in love.\n\n\nSIX YEARS BEFORE PRESENT - VII\n\n\tI wake up and look through the window.\n\t“Hey,” I say to her, “Wake up.” She is sprawled on the ground, wearing the same clothing she had yestersession. Her arm twitches, then she reveals the room to her eyes.\n\t“Huh?” she sits up and strokes her eyes, “Good morning.”\nThrough the glass between, I ask her, “What is the Deliver?”\n\tShe leans to the direction of me, “This looks like a cube.” She shows me, it is a green, painted wooden block the size of her hands. “Do you have anything?” she asks.\n“Only my journal and a pen,” I answer. I turn to after the last page I had written on and write a new entry for tosession’s Deliver. Wait. There are journal entries I do not recall writing. They list names of food numbered in dishes and include objects I have never heard of. I stop.\n“What’s wrong?” she questions.\n“I felt like I had a dream,” I look down at my ring finger to find only my hand. I look through the window to find an empty room with a person I care about.\n“I have that feeling too,” she assures me with.\nMy ears sense a buzzing feeling, as if a speaker was playing static. I collapse onto the ground.\n“What is this?” I scream.\n“Help me!” I hear from the other room. I struggle to stand and look through the window. She is curled up on the ground with her hands gripping onto her eyes. “I can’t see....”\n“How do I help?” I try to damage the window by punching it. It remains unscathed. I look down at the green cube Deliver. It is not there; instead, it is replaced by a colorful object.\nMy ears produce static again, but this time, I hear words.\nThis is a Rubik’s cube. She will regain her sight as soon as it solved.\n“Who are you?” I shout. The voice does not answer.\n“What’s wrong?” she asks me.\n“The cube has been replaced by another deliver. You have to solve a puzzle to regain your sight.”\n“Where did you hear that from?”\n“I heard it from a Deliver,” I lie to keep her calm. She blindly grabs the cube.\n“How do I solve it?”\n“Wait,” I tell her as I look through my journal. Strangely, I find an entry for the green block already written. Turning to the last written page, I find an entry with the cubic puzzle. Here, many details about it are listed, including: a time it arrived, the history of it, the number of pieces it has, the number of combinations, and methods to solve it. I do not remember taking this entry.\n“What is it?”\n“I found entries in the journal I do not remember writing,” I tell her, “There is one for the cube.”\n“Do you know how to solve it?”\n“Yes, please stand next to the window with it and listen very carefully.”\nStep by step, I tell her how to solve it. In a world with no sense of time, this process takes forever, yet it is very quick. Surely enough, she regains her eyesight after we finish.\n“I can see again!” she cries, “Thank you!”\n“No problem,” I take my journal. “What was that?”\n“It doesn’t matter anymore. Can you show me the new journal entries?”\nI read through all the entries with her, learning new things without Delivers. We have to imagine how they look, so I sketch every object on new pages. We spend the time together, learning about this alternate version of us.\nI do not remember how much time we spent talking about that, or the cube. It may have been an eternity, but we did it until the end of that Session.\n\n\nSIX YEARS BEFORE PRESENT - VIII\n\n\tToday’s Deliver is a journal.\n\nI wake up from a nightmare. I remember the previous day and everything else. I am in the full room again, the one without the presence of a wall. I remember how Hope went blind the day before, and that I could not remember her name or the rings we shared. I recall illustrating everything in the journal, and telling her how to solve the puzzle, but it felt like that was years ago.\nHope is sleeping on the floor. I shake her awake.\n“Hey! I want to talk to you about something.”\nShe opens her eyes.\n“Huh? What is it?”\n“Do you remember ever losing your vision?”\n“What? I think I do, but it felt like it was a long time ago.”\n“I think it was yesterday.”\n\t“What is today’s deliver?” she asks, looking at the clock.\n\tWe cannot find any new items, and the only thing modified was the journal. We skim through it and find the sketches from yesterday. We conclude that the journal is the Deliver.\n\n\tLosing memories is a scary concept. That you will forget things when you go to sleep. Writing in the journal is the only way around it. The endless journal is the end to the ends.\n\n\tI write in the journal about today’s Deliver, assuming that yestersession may happen again:\n\tHer name is Hope. I am Wish. We share a single room together with no windows or doors. In this room, we receive Delivers every day. Yesterday, our memories were reset and we were given a task. The entity that gave the task is unknown, but it may be a test. If none of the information sounds familiar, but read through the journal for missing information.\n\n\t“Why do we exist?” Hope asks me again. I respond to her question.\n\t“I think we are from Earth. We are developing humans to be made the most productive. We are experiments.”\n\t“I agree with you,” she frowns with a smile.\n\n\nFOUR YEARS BEFORE PRESENT - IX\n\n\tIt was only the first time. Another Reset happened on the following day. When I awoke, we were examining an object from two years ago, a pencil. This time, I was quickly able to realize what was happening. Reading the page I wrote the day before, I recovered much information about the joined rooms. The objective Entity gave us was to create a fire, with no disabilities. Of course this was not the last time.\n\tFrom memory, I tallied that we were trialed by Entity a total 127 times, each event with a day in the joined room. We never failed a test. The trust and cooperation between Hope and I built. We knew that this was only the dawn of a greater challenge.\n\n\nFOUR YEARS BEFORE PRESENT - X\n\n\tIsolation is an unfortunate being.\n\n\tI wake up to see the leaves of an expiring tree transcending above me. When I realize that Hope is still gone, I stand up and look at the rift.\n\nThis hole is what replaced the wall as time went along. What used to confined rooms guided by Sessions and Delivers ended up becoming two small wildernesses, isolated from each other levitating in a void. They only spawned when the Trials began, which is the point in my life when Entity gave us consequences for the tasks we did not complete. Mainly, of the distance between our rooms expanding for whenever a task was not executed. At a point, the distance was too great to see Hope’s room, and beyond to communicate. All we could do is listen.",
//  "Blue Facility \n\n There, I see it again.\n“Help!” I scream into the darkness. Then, I feel drowsy. The universe around me slows down as if I am drifting to sleep. I slowly lose my senses, the world fades to a black. I cannot hear anything except for a long beeping noise, then it goes away. Complete silence, I feel blind, not only with my eyes, but with my entire body. Limp, numb, I feel like I am dead, yet for some reason I know I am not. Which way is up, which way is down? Which way is home? I lose my sense of time, how long has it been so far? It feels like years, but it seems like only a second of this eternal torture has existed. Existed? Did anything in my life really happen? It was so long ago, since the darkness engulfed me.\n“Help!” I scream, but I do not hear the other side of it. It appears as if I did not speak at all. Speak? What a funny phrase. Phrase, is that a word? I forgot. What do these sounds even mean? Who were my friends? \nI burrow through my mind, one that does not exist, but I cannot produce any thoughts. What are these “words” I am saying in my mind?\nMind?\nIs that?\nWha-?\nUh-\nThe-\nHow-?\nHelp!\nHelp?\n\n\n\nPart 1 - Tomb\n\nI cannot see in this dark place, but I know I am being dragged along a path. A firm hand grips tightly to my left arm. The hold burns, it slowly burning off my skin. I see light near the horizon of this world. It grows nearer and nearer. Eventually, it casts the silhouette of the figure in front of me. I do not recognize the person, as I cannot identify people from two tones of color, yet I know that this person cannot be associated with me. The light between the end of this void and the abyss we are in eventually becomes a smooth gradient outlining a door to reality. The person’s silhouette cascades and retracts when I am near the light. Scouting what is around me, I conclude that the light is my only option.\nStep. Step again. Step, yet again. With shorter distance, it is revealed that the light is not just a light, but an entrance to so white-walled room. I run to it, because I want to explore, because I want to stay no more seconds in this featureless place. The light blooms like life does in spring. The radiance smiles warmly at me, and I smile back. When I am a meter away from in, I do not hesitate to embrace the new landscape. The brightness stings my eyes, and I slowly adjust to the pace of the unfamiliar tone.\n\tIt takes me a few minutes to register the new room. It is completely white padded, it seems like the luminescence comes from the padded floor. I look around for the entrance I came from, but I cannot find it. The gift I had taken appears to be a trap. I was so desolate and desperate that I feel into this constricting, cramped room. The room is a perfect cube, about two meters in all dimensions. It is so plain, I cannot describe anymore.\n\tI start to angrily bang on the cushioned wall, yelling, but I have no response. I retreat and curl up into a little ball like an armadillo in the corner of this room, as if the corners were not close to each other.\nWhy was I sent here? Where am I?\nI slowly drift away, my eyelids quietly closing the gates of my vision to this world.\n\nWhen I wake up, I feel starved. I weakly force myself to stand, “How long have I been here?” I ask. My muscles feel tight, and my throat as dry as desert. I do not have the energy to do anything, so I do not do anything. I sit back down, then realize there is a tiny drop of water on the soft floor. I bring my frail hand to touch the water. It feels cool, hydrating my dry skin. I look around the small room for where it came from. Then I notice, between the seams of the pads on the ceiling is a small hole. I assume it is a leak, yet I thank the mistake that brings life to this boring room. Too tired to do anything thing else, I lie down.\nWho designed this place? Why am I still alive?\n\nI wake up again another day. Can I really call this another day? In this confined area, I cannot tell when it is day, night, or when the sun rises again. I feel very feeble, my limbs are limp and my body is heavy. I stare at the leaking hole in the ceiling.\nDrip. Drip. Drip.\nI cannot turn my eyes away from it, because I do not have the energy to as I do not have the energy to close my eyes again. I feel exhausted, as if I had just completed a sprint over a distance that physicians would call unhealthy. Then, I hear a noise.\nA noise? Noise, noise, noise. That seems like an unfamiliar word, though the noise feels like a casting light in a cavern of gloom. It sounds like a giggle, when was the last time I heard a sound? It laughs like it is taunting me, but I find it warm. It soon disappears and I hear a long beep noise. My ears like candles unlit, I smile. The beep sound gets louder and clearer. It soon becomes a distinct noise. Noise, noise, noise.\n\tI want to listen to the melodic, monotone voice a little longer, but my fatigue denies it. The world around me disappears.\n"
